We assume you know how to open up your terminal: 

(1) your very first step (or if you mess up or if you can't find the folder)

Assuming that you do not have a folder called "550400.git" in your computer,
you can type in your command line:

cd ~/
git clone http://cis.jhu.edu/~nhlee/550400.git

this creates a folder in your computer that is called 
"550400.git" and populates afresh with the contents of 
the course folder.

(2) incremental update step

Assuming that you did not mesh up your git folder by,
for example, deleting or modifying things, do:

cd ~/550400.git
git reset --hard HEAD
git pull origin master

(3) Do & Don't 

Use the course folder as if it is a bag of precious templates or references. 
In particular, I would like to discourage (but necessarily forbid) you 
from deleting, editing, adding things in the course folder and from 
changing the course folder name. 

Keep the folder relatively "clean", and copy things from it to another folder.
Particularly, be very careful with dragging things from the course folder to 
another folder. In some computer, drag-and-drop means cut-and-place.
